# Asteroids

An [Asteroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game)) clone written in Rust and Bevy. Game number four on the [20 Games Challenge](https://20_games_challenge.gitlab.io/challenge/).

## Goal 
* [x] Create a player ship. The ship should be able to rotate and thrust. Thrust will accelerate the ship “forward” in the direction that it is facing.
* [ ] Enable screen wrapping. (Objects leaving the top of the screen should enter the bottom, for example)
* [ ] Add bullets. The player ship will fire in the direction that it is facing. Bullets will disappear after a short while.
* [ ] Create three sizes of asteroids.
* [ ] Asteroids will break into smaller asteroids when shot (The smallest will disappear when shot).
* [ ] Asteroids will drift around until they are shot or they collide with the player. If the player collides with an asteroid, they will lose a life.
* [ ] Add menus and UI.
* [ ] Add sound effects and particle effects.

## Stretch goal
* [ ] Add a flying saucer that enters the screen and shoots at the player from time to time. The saucer should generally aim towards the player, but shouldn’t have too good of aim!
* [ ] Add a “hyperspace warp” that moves the player to a random part of the screen. The warp is a last-ditch attempt to dodge an asteroid, but it could place you in a worse predicament!
* [ ] Make it your own - This is a great game to add some custom power-ups to.
